# Game-Swap-APP-
The purpose of this project is to analyze, specify, design, implement, document, and demonstrate an app. 
The system was implemented using a fully  relational, distinct  Database Management System (DBMS) that utilizes tables and  supports standard SQL queries. 
In recent years, the sales of board games, video game systems, and other home entertainment activities skyrocketed.   
Today, many people find themselves with a surplus of games and other items.  GameSwap is a bartering website for  trading these items.  
Initially, it will be limited to some specific types of items and is intended for making local trades,  
although users who are not located close to each other might figure out shipping details on their own.
